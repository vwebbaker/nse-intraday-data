# 📊 ANALYSIS PROMPT - PROFESSIONAL UPGRADE

**Date:** November 16, 2025  
**Version:** 2.0 (Professional-Grade)  
**Focus:** High-Probability Futures Setups with Intelligent Reasoning

---

## 🔄 WHAT CHANGED?

### ❌ OLD PROMPT (Basic):
```
- Simple bullet-point criteria
- 5 generic analysis points
- No reasoning requirements
- Fixed pattern thinking
- No risk management focus
- 80 lines, basic structure
```

### ✅ NEW PROMPT (Professional):
```
- Comprehensive multi-factor framework
- 6 detailed analysis dimensions
- Intelligent reasoning demanded
- Confluence-based approach
- Risk-aware thinking required
- 339 lines, professional structure
```

---

## 🎯 KEY IMPROVEMENTS:

### 1️⃣ **INTELLIGENT REASONING (Not Fixed Patterns)**

**OLD:**
> "Check if FII is net long or short"

**NEW:**
> **Why This Matters:** FII/DII are informed players. When they build large positions, it signals institutional conviction. When retail opposes them, probability increases.

**Impact:** AI now understands **WHY** each factor matters, leading to better reasoning.

---

### 2️⃣ **MULTI-FACTOR CONFLUENCE (3+ Signals Required)**

**OLD:**
> Generic 5-point checklist

**NEW:**
```
✅ Factor 1: FII/DII Positioning
✅ Factor 2: OI + Price Action
✅ Factor 3: Volatility Edge
✅ Factor 4: Global Context
✅ Factor 5: Pre-Open Signals
✅ Factor 6: Technical Confluence

HIGH PROBABILITY = 3+ factors aligned
VERY HIGH PROBABILITY = 5+ factors aligned
```

**Impact:** Stock qualifies ONLY if multiple independent signals converge.

---

### 3️⃣ **DEEP REASONING REQUIRED**

**OLD:**
> "Reasoning: FII position, OI trend, Volatility"

**NEW:**
> For EACH stock, AI must explain:
> - **✅ Factor 1:** Institutional Positioning (with numbers)
> - **✅ Factor 2:** OI + Price Dynamics (with interpretation)
> - **✅ Factor 3:** Volatility Edge (with opportunity)
> - **✅ Factor 4:** Global Context (with alignment)
> - **✅ Factor 5:** Pre-Open Confirmation (with signal)
> - **✅ Factor 6:** Technical Setup (with trigger)

**Impact:** AI must JUSTIFY every recommendation with specific data points.

---

### 4️⃣ **RISK MANAGEMENT FOCUS**

**OLD:**
> "Risk Rating: Low/Medium/High"

**NEW:**
```
⚠️ RISK FACTORS:
- What could go wrong?
- Exit triggers
- Position sizing
- Stop loss reasoning

TRADE PLAN:
- Bullish scenario (probability %)
- Bearish scenario (probability %)
- Time management (entry/exit windows)
```

**Impact:** Every trade has a clear risk mitigation plan.

---

### 5️⃣ **FUTURES-ONLY FOCUS**

**OLD:**
> "Intraday trading recommendations"

**NEW:**
```
💰 FUTURES CONTRACT: Current Month (Nov 2025)
📊 LOT SIZE: X shares per lot
📍 Risk per lot: ₹X,XXX
📍 Position Size: Max 2-3 lots
```

**Impact:** AI knows it's ONLY futures, provides lot-based calculations.

---

### 6️⃣ **STRUCTURED OUTPUT TEMPLATE**

**OLD:**
```
1. Stock Name & Symbol
2. Trade Direction
3. Entry Range
4. Stop Loss
5. Target
6. Reasoning (brief)
```

**NEW:**
```
📈 STOCK #1: [DETAILED TABLE FORMAT]

🎯 ENTRY STRATEGY:
| Parameter | Value | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Entry Zone | ₹XXX | Why this level? |
| Stop Loss | ₹XXX | Risk: ₹X,XXX |
| Target 1 | ₹XXX | 60% probability |
| Target 2 | ₹XXX | 40% probability |
| Risk:Reward | 1:2+ | Minimum ratio |

🧠 REASONING: [6 factors with detailed analysis]

⚠️ RISK FACTORS: [What can go wrong]

🎯 TRADE PLAN: [Bullish/Bearish scenarios]

💡 CONVICTION LEVEL: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
```

**Impact:** AI provides structured, actionable trade plans.

---

## 🧠 REASONING FRAMEWORK EXPLAINED:

### 🏦 1. INSTITUTIONAL POSITIONING (Smart Money)
**What AI Learns:**
- FII/DII = Smart money with research teams
- When they build positions, they have conviction
- Retail vs. Institutions = contrarian signal
- Proprietary traders alignment = confirmation

**Example Output:**
```
FII: Net Long → ₹2,450 cr buildup
DII: Net Short → ₹180 cr reduction
Retail: Net Short → ₹2,270 cr (opposing FII)

Conclusion: Smart money (FII) is aggressively bullish,
while retail is shorting. Classic setup for upside.
```

---

### 📈 2. OI + PRICE ACTION DYNAMICS
**What AI Learns:**
- Increasing OI + Price = Fresh commitment
- Decreasing OI = Unwinding (temporary moves)
- High OI = Strong conviction
- Unusual OI = Upcoming volatility

**Example Output:**
```
Previous OI: 15.2 lakh → Current OI: 18.7 lakh (+23%)
Price: ₹850 → ₹865 (+1.76%)

Interpretation: Fresh Long buildup with strong volume.
Institutions are adding positions, not covering.
```

---

### ⚡ 3. VOLATILITY SCREENING
**What AI Learns:**
- High IV = More intraday movement
- Rising IV = Big move coming
- High IV + High OI = Institutional interest
- High IV + Low OI = Speculative (avoid)

**Example Output:**
```
IV: 38% (High for this stock)
Previous Day Range: ₹18 (₹842-₹860)
Expected Range Today: ₹22-₹25 (based on IV)

Opportunity: Good for intraday scalping (2-3% moves)
```

---

### 🌍 4. GLOBAL CONTEXT
**What AI Learns:**
- Indian markets follow global cues
- Sectoral rotation matters
- Commodities impact specific stocks
- Risk-on vs. Risk-off sentiment

**Example Output:**
```
US Markets: S&P +0.5%, Nasdaq +0.8% (Risk-on)
Asian Markets: Nikkei +1.2% (following US)
Gift Nifty: +0.35% (indicates gap-up)
Sector: IT stocks outperforming globally

Alignment: Our long setup matches global bullish flow.
```

---

### 🕐 5. PRE-OPEN SIGNALS
**What AI Learns:**
- Gaps reveal overnight sentiment
- Pre-open volume = institutional interest
- Order book = immediate bias
- Gap + OI = high probability continuation

**Example Output:**
```
Gap: +1.2% (₹850 → ₹860)
Pre-Open Volume: 2.8 lakh (3x normal)
Order Book: 85,000 buy vs. 42,000 sell (2:1 ratio)

Signal: Strong institutional buying in pre-open.
Gap likely to sustain.
```

---

### 📊 6. TECHNICAL CONFLUENCE
**What AI Learns:**
- Price at decision points = good risk:reward
- Support/resistance = institutional levels
- Breakouts need OI confirmation
- Round numbers = psychological levels

**Example Output:**
```
Key Levels:
- Support: ₹840 (previous swing low)
- Resistance: ₹875 (weekly high)
- Current: ₹865 (breaking out)

Setup: Breakout above ₹865 with OI buildup.
Next target: ₹875-₹880 (measured move)
```

---

## 🎯 HIGH-PROBABILITY CRITERIA:

**Stock qualifies ONLY if:**

| Factors Aligned | Probability | Action |
|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| **1-2 factors** | Low (40-50%) | ❌ Skip |
| **3-4 factors** | High (60-70%) | ✅ Take trade |
| **5-6 factors** | Very High (75-85%) | ✅✅ High conviction |

**This ensures we only take the BEST setups, not every setup.**
