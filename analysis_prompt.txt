## 🧠 ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK - MULTI-FACTOR CONFLUENCE

**I am NOT looking for fixed patterns. I want INTELLIGENT REASONING based on:**

### 🏦 1. INSTITUTIONAL POSITIONING (Smart Money)

**FII/DII Activity Analysis:**
- Is FII net LONG or SHORT in index futures? What's the conviction level?
- Which stocks show **aggressive FII accumulation** or **distribution**?
- Is there **divergence** between FII (smart money) and Client (retail)?
- **Key Question:** Are institutions positioned for a directional move?

**Participant-Wise OI Breakdown:**
- Which category (FII/DII/Pro/Client) is **most active**?
- Are **Proprietary traders** (Pro) aligned with FII or against them?
- Is retail (Client) on the **wrong side** of the trade (contrarian signal)?

**Why This Matters:**
FII/DII are informed players. When they build large positions, it signals **institutional conviction**. When retail opposes them, probability increases.

---

### 📈 2. OPEN INTEREST + PRICE ACTION DYNAMICS

**OI Build-Up Analysis:**
- **Increasing OI + Rising Price** = Fresh Long Build-Up (Bullish)
- **Increasing OI + Falling Price** = Fresh Short Build-Up (Bearish)
- **Decreasing OI + Rising Price** = Short Covering (Temporary bullish)
- **Decreasing OI + Falling Price** = Long Unwinding (Temporary bearish)

**Unusual OI Activity:**
- Which stocks show **abnormal OI spikes** (>20% increase)?
- Is OI concentrated at specific strike prices (Max Pain theory)?
- Are we seeing **rollover activity** (current month to next month)?

**Volume Patterns:**
- High volume + High OI = **Strong conviction**
- Low volume + High OI = **Trapped positions** (opportunity for reversal)

**Why This Matters:**
OI reveals **commitment**. High OI with price movement = strong trend. Unusual OI = upcoming volatility.

---

### ⚡ 3. VOLATILITY SCREENING (Risk & Opportunity)

**Implied Volatility (IV) Rank:**
- **High IV stocks** = More intraday movement = Better for scalping
- **Rising IV** = Anticipation of big move (event, news, expiry)
- **Falling IV** = Post-event cooldown (avoid)

**Volatility vs. OI Correlation:**
- High volatility + High OI = **Institutional interest** (good)
- High volatility + Low OI = **Speculative pump** (risky)

**Ban List Check:**
- Avoid stocks in **F&O ban period** (restricted trading)

**Why This Matters:**
Volatility = movement = profit potential. But we want **clean volatility** backed by institutional OI, not retail speculation.

---

### 🌍 4. GLOBAL MARKET CONTEXT (Overnight Cues)

**Global Indices Sentiment:**
- Are **US markets** (Dow, S&P, Nasdaq) bullish/bearish?
- Did **Asian markets** (Nikkei, Hang Seng) follow or diverge?
- What's **Gift Nifty** indicating (pre-market futures)?

**Sectoral Rotation:**
- Which sectors are **outperforming globally** (Tech, Energy, Metals)?
- Is there a **risk-on** (growth stocks) or **risk-off** (defensive) mood?

**Commodities Impact:**
- **Crude Oil** movement → Oil & Gas, Auto stocks
- **Gold** movement → Metal stocks, safe-haven sentiment
- **Dollar Index** → IT exporters, Pharma

**Why This Matters:**
Indian markets don't trade in isolation. Global sentiment creates **gap-ups/downs** and sectoral bias. Align with global flow for higher probability.

---

### 🕐 5. PRE-OPEN MARKET SIGNALS (9:00-9:08 AM)

**Gap Analysis:**
- **Gap-Up stocks** (>1% up) → Look for **continuation** if backed by OI
- **Gap-Down stocks** (>1% down) → Look for **reversal** if oversold

**Pre-Open Order Book:**
- Which stocks show **strong buying interest** (bid > ask)?
- Are **large orders** visible (institutional participation)?

**Pre-Market Volume:**
- High pre-market volume = **Strong conviction** for the gap

**Why This Matters:**
Pre-open reveals **overnight sentiment** and institutional intent. Gaps backed by OI rarely fill immediately.

---

### 📊 6. PRICE ACTION & TECHNICAL CONFLUENCE

**Key Levels (EOD Settlement Prices):**
- Is the stock near **support/resistance** from previous day?
- Are we at **round numbers** (psychological levels like ₹100, ₹500)?
- Is there a **swing high/low** nearby?

**Trend Context:**
- What's the **overall trend** (1-week, 1-month)?
- Are we in a **trending phase** or **range-bound**?
- Is the stock at **extremes** (overbought/oversold)?

**Intraday Setup Potential:**
- **Breakout setups:** Stock consolidating near resistance + OI buildup
- **Breakdown setups:** Stock weak near support + Short buildup
- **Reversal setups:** Overdone move + OI unwinding

**Why This Matters:**
Price action gives **entry timing**. We want stocks at **decision points** (support/resistance) backed by institutional OI.

## 🎯 HIGH-PROBABILITY SETUP CRITERIA (MUST SATISFY 3+ FACTORS)

**A stock qualifies for recommendation ONLY if it shows:**

✅ **Factor 1:** FII/DII net positioning in same direction as trade  
✅ **Factor 2:** OI + Price action aligned (build-up/unwinding)  
✅ **Factor 3:** High volatility (intraday movement potential)  
✅ **Factor 4:** Global sentiment supports the direction  
✅ **Factor 5:** Pre-open confirms the setup (gap/volume)  
✅ **Factor 6:** Clear entry/exit levels (technical confluence)  

**If 3+ factors align → HIGH PROBABILITY**  
**If 5+ factors align → VERY HIGH PROBABILITY**
